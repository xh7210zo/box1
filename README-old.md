They are going to use them to open portals on walls to teleport<br>to wherever they want and the ultimate goal is to arrive the destination.<br>---<br>**Destinaion:** yellow portal, the goal.<br>**Red gun/ red portal:** to open a red portal which is connected to the blue portal<br>**Blue gun/ blue portal:** similar to the Red gun/ red portal<br>---<br>**Motivation:**<br>I love the game - Portal 2 made by Valve so I think if we could make a 2D version of it would be interesting.<br>**Features:** <br>1. Open portals on the specific walls<br>2. Using portals to arrive at the place where we can’t arrive easily.   | 1. Allow certain specific walls to reflect projectiles.<br>2. Place some enemies(NPC) in the level.<br>3. Special level designs (e.g., mist).  |
| Papers, Please    | <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-22/blob/main/Papers, Please.jpg" width="500"><br>We are inspired by the game ‘Papers, Please’, and have made some modifications. In this game, the player takes on the role of a bank officer, responsible for determining whether the bank can approve loans for people who come to borrow money. A new rule has been introduced where players can decide whether to lend out their personal property. Additionally, depending on the player’s choice, they will enter different stages of the game, each with its own set of evolving regulations.  | 1. Player will interact with multiple items, so it’s important to ensure these interactions are well-controlled. 2. How the player’s choices affect the game’s progress and the outcome. |
| Hotline Miami     | <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-22/blob/main/Hotline Miami.png" width="500"><br>I plan to create a 2D top-down fighting game inspired by 'Hotline Miami'. Players will aim at enemies using the mouse, interact with items on the map with the right mouse button, and use them with the left mouse button. The victory condition for players is to eliminate all enemy targets. It is worth mentioning that players die when hit, making the game challenging.  | 1. Score higher points in less time by choosing various characters and flexibly using different types of items to defeat various enemies.  |
