Research games and upload a list of games you find inspiring to your team’s repo, including details of the game mechanics

## Game Mechanics

| Portal 2D            | <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-22/blob/main/images/Portal.png" width="500"><br>1. Physical Engine: For instance, the trajectory of bullets, the gravity, the speed of the matchstick man and the movements of the matchstick man should all be considered.<br>2. Puzzle solving: The players should brainstorm to solve the different puzzles to arrive the goal, such as they should plan where should they go first to trigger some mechanism or they may fall in traps.<br>3. bject collision: The matchstick man can’t pass through some walls or jump over some mechanisms. The players should generate portals to pass them instea.d<br>4. Multiple levels: The difficulty will increase level by level. For example, the players might use more portal in the late levels, or have to spend more time to think about how to arrive the goal. | 1. It is necessary to accurately calculate the angle, speed, and gravity of the bullet to ensure that they can hit a specific wall.<br>2. Smoothly and accurately control the speed, jumping, landing, and interaction with the environment of the matchstick man to avoid the delay or abnormal behavior caused by complex physical calculations.<br>3. Make sure the speed of the character through the portal is maintained, (or changed in some special cases or portals), and the game environment is updated correctly.<br>4. Avoid dead ends, such as cases of unlimited bullet ejection, we can limit the number of bullets ejection. And avoid sending the portal to an illegal location.<br>5. New ideas, such as reversing the effects of gravity in some of the increased difficulty levels, or adding some time constraints.|
| Hotline Miami     | <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-22/blob/main/images/Hotline Miami.png" width="500"><br>1. Attack Methods: Follow the mouse. Melee weapons have a semicircular attack range around the player, and their speed decays with distance when the weapen was being thrown. Firearms and throwing weapons follow the mouse direction.<br>2. Bullets: Different items have different bullet speeds and spreads. This can be achieved by setting random values within different ranges.<br>3. Movement Speed: The movement speed of the player and different types of enemies is fixed but varies between them.<br>4. Walls: Players will be detected around glass walls, and bullets can pass through the glass. Moving behind solid walls will prevent the detection of enemies and block their bullets. This is determined by detecting if the player is staying behind solid walls.<br>5. Death: The player dies instantly when being hit and restart from the checkpoint.<br>6. Victory Condition: The level is cleared when all enemies are detected to be eliminated and the game is saved. | 1. AI Logic: Implement patrols at fixed locations and enemy locking within a fixed range. After locking onto an enemy, the AI will automatically pathfind to the latest location where the player was detected and use their weapons.<br>2. Boss: Has more attack methods.|
